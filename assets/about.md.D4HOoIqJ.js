I worked my way up from bartender to Assistant General Manager at Flying Saucer, where I learned to manage people, solve operational challenges, and stay cool under pressure.</p><p>Eventually, I decided to chase something new. I took classes at Collin College and fell in love with programming. Logic puzzles and brain teasers have always been my thing — and it turns out, software development is full of them.</p><p>That realization led me to UT Dallas, where I earned my CS degree and built things I never thought possible:</p><ul><li>A virtual CPU</li><li>A color-matching ML model</li><li>A LEGO sorter powered by Raspberry Pi</li></ul><p>I also interned as a Software Engineer at CBRE, where I got hands-on with real systems that solved real problems. I love combining creativity, systems thinking, and a little bit of fun.</p><hr><h2 id="what-i-m-looking-for" tabindex="-1">What I&#39;m Looking For <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-i-m-looking-for" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What I&#39;m Looking For&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I&#39;m currently open to <strong>full-time software development roles</strong> — especially where I can keep learning and explore AI, systems, or creative tools.</p><ul><li>I thrive in collaborative, curious teams</li><li>I enjoy technical challenges that blend design and logic</li><li>I’m at my best when I’m experimenting, prototyping, or automating something unexpected</li></ul><hr><h2 id="my-values-style" tabindex="-1">My Values &amp; Style <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-values-style" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;My Values &amp; Style&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>I&#39;m thoughtful and deliberate — I like to understand the “why” before diving into the “how”</li><li>I value clarity, kindness, and communication</li><li>I believe knowledge grows when it&#39;s shared — collaborating and lifting others up leads to better solutions</li><li>My dream job is one where I get paid to learn</li></ul><hr><h2 id="let-s-connect" tabindex="-1">Let’s Connect <a class="header-anchor" href="#let-s-connect" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Let’s Connect&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you:</p><ul><li>Need someone who can break down complex ideas clearly</li><li>Appreciate curiosity and clever solutions</li><li>Want to chat tech — or solve a logic puzzle just for fun!</li></ul><p>Then I’d love to hear from you!<br> You can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtneyspencer12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reach me on LinkedIn</a> or <a href="/portfolio-site/projects.html">check out my projects</a>.</p>',19)]))}const p=t(n,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
