# About Courtney

Hi, I’m Courtney — a creative problem-solver, recent CS grad, and former restaurant manager turned software engineer.

My journey didn’t start in tech — it started behind the bar. I worked my way up from bartender to Assistant General Manager at Flying Saucer, where I learned to manage people, solve operational challenges, and stay cool under pressure.

Eventually, I decided to chase something new. I took classes at Collin College and fell in love with programming. Logic puzzles and brain teasers have always been my thing — and it turns out, software development is full of them.

That realization led me to UT Dallas, where I earned my CS degree and built things I never thought possible:
- A virtual CPU  
- A color-matching ML model  
- A LEGO sorter powered by Raspberry Pi

## My Time at CBRE

During the summer of my senior year, I interned as a Software Engineer at CBRE on the Global Workplace Solutions team. It was my first experience contributing to large-scale systems in a corporate environment — and I absolutely loved it.

I worked closely with automation tools, helped transition processes into more scalable systems, and gained a deeper appreciation for how enterprise software actually runs behind the scenes.

The best part? Being surrounded by sharp, supportive people who encouraged me to ask questions and stay curious. I left the internship more confident in my skills and even more excited to keep building things that matter.

## What I'm Looking For

I’m currently open to **full-time software development roles** — especially where I can keep learning and explore AI, systems, or creative tools.

- I thrive in collaborative, curious teams.  
- I enjoy technical challenges that blend design and logic.  
- I’m at my best when I’m experimenting, prototyping, or automating something unexpected.

## My Values & Style

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <img src="/about_me_photos/xena_odin.jpeg" alt="Xena and Odin" style="max-width: 300px; border-radius: 12px;" />
  <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; font-style: italic; margin: 0;">
    Xena (left) and Odin (right), my two very serious coworkers. Productivity is questionable, but morale is high!
  </p>
</div>

- I’m thoughtful and deliberate — I like to understand the “why” before diving into the “how.”  
- I value clarity, kindness, and communication.  
- I believe knowledge grows when it’s shared — collaborating and lifting others up leads to better solutions.  
- My dream job is one where I get paid to learn.
